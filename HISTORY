------------------
NEW FEATURES
 * Issue 32: Per-process CPU user/kernel times
 * Issue 33: Process create time
 * Issue 34: Per-process CPU utilization percentage
 * Issue 38: Per-process memory usage (bytes)
 * Issue 41: Per-process memory utilization (percent)
 * Issue 39: System uptime
 * Issue 43: Total system virtual memory
 * Issue 46: Total system physical memory
 * Issue 44: Total system used/free virtual and physical memory

BUGFIXES
 * Issue 36: NoSuchProcess not raised on Windows when accessing timing methods
 * Issue 40: test_get_cpu_times() failing on FreeBSD and OS X
 * Issue 42: get_memory_percent() raises AccessDenied on Windows


0.1.1 - 2009-03-06
------------------
NEW FEATURES
 * Issue 4: FreeBSD support for all functions of psutil
 * Issue 9: Process.uid and Process.gid now retrieve process UID and GID.
 * Issue 11: Support for parent/ppid - Process.parent property returns a
   Process object representing the parent process, and Process.ppid returns

 * Issue 12 & 15: NoSuchProcess exception now raised when creating an object
   for a nonexistent process, or when retrieving information about a process
   that has gone away.
 * Issue 21: AccessDenied exception created for raising access denied errors
   from OSError or WindowsError on individual platforms.
 * Issue 26: psutil.process_iter() function to iterate over processes as
   Process objects with a generator.
 * Process objects can now also be compared with == operator for equality
   (PID, name, command line are compared).

BUGFIXES
 * Issue 16: Special case for Windows' "System Idle Process" (PID 0) which
   otherwise would return an "invalid parameter" exception.
 * Issue 17: get_process_list() ignores NoSuchProcess and AccessDenied
   exceptions during building of the list.
 * Issue 22: Process(0).kill() was failing on Windows with an unset exception
 * Issue 23: Special case for pid_exists(0)
 * Issue 24: Process(0).kill() now raises AccessDenied exception instead of
   WindowsError.
 * Issue 30: psutil.get_pid_list() was returning two instances of PID 0 on OS
   X and FreeBSD platforms.
