TODO

A collection of ideas and notes about stuff to implement in future versions.
"#NNN" occurrences refer to bug tracker issues at:
https://code.google.com/p/psutil/issues/list


HIGHER PRIORITY
===============

 * #387: system-wide connections (netstat) aka psutil.net_connections().

 * #250: net ifaces speed.

 * #376: ifconfig functionalities aka psutil.net_ifaces (could be merged
         with #250)

 * OpenBSD support.

 * #371: CPU temperature (apparently OSX and Linux only; on Linux it requires
   lm-sensors lib).

 * #424: Windows binary for Python 3.3 64-bit.

 * #269: expose network ifaces RX/TW queues.


LOWER PRIORITY
==============

 * #355: Android support.

 * #276: GNU/Hurd support.

 * NetBSD support?

 * DranflyBSD support?

 * AIX support?

 * examples/pidof.py (same as 'pidof' cli tool)

 * examples/pstree.py (same as 'pstree' cli tool)
    * get_threads() should also return thread names in order to implement it

 * examples/taskmgr-gui.py (using tk).

 * system-wide number of open file descriptors:
    * https://jira.hyperic.com/browse/SIGAR-30
    * http://www.netadmintools.com/part295.html

 * Number of system threads.
    * Windows: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684824(v=vs.85).aspx

 * #357: what CPU a process is on.

 * thread names:
    * https://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/issues/detail?id=65

 * Asynchronous psutil.Popen (see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3145/)


DEBATABLE
=========

 * advanced cmdline interface exposing the whole API and providing different
   kind of outputs (e.g. pprinted, colorized, json).

 * [Linux]: process cgroups (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups). They look
   similar to prlimit() in terms of functionality but uglier (they should allow
   limiting per-process network IO resources though, which is great). Needs
   further reading.

 * psutil.cpu_percent() and psutil.Process.get_cpu_percent():
   current default interval is 0.1 so that by default it will produce a
   meaningful value. It represents a trap in case the user iterates over
   multiple processes though, as it introduces a big slowdown.
   Should it default to 0.0?

 * Should we expose OS constants (psutil.WINDOWS, psutil.OSX etc.)?

 * Python 3.3. exposed different sched.h functions:
   http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.3.html#os
   http://bugs.python.org/issue12655
   http://docs.python.org/dev/library/os.html#interface-to-the-scheduler
   It might be worth to take a look and figure out whether we can include some
   of those in psutil.
   Also, we can probably reimplement wait_pid() on POSIX which is currently
   implemented as a busy-loop.

 * Certain systems (XXX figure out which ones exactly) provide CPU times about
   process children. On those systems Process.get_cpu_times() might return
   a (user, system, user_children, system_children) ntuple.

 * Enrich exception classes hierarchy on Python >= 3.3 / post PEP-3151 so that:
   - NoSuchProcess inherits from ProcessLookupError
   - AccessDenied inherits from PermissionError
   - TimeoutExpired inherits from TimeoutError (debatable)
   See: http://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#os-exceptions

 * Process.get_threads() might grow an extra "id" parameter so that it can be
   used as such:

    >>> p = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
    >>> p.get_threads(id=psutil.get_current_thread_id())
    thread(id=2539, user_time=0.03, system_time=0.02)
    >>>

   Note: this leads to questions such as "should we have a custom NoSuchThread
   exception? Also see issue #418.

   Note #2: this would work with os.getpid() only.
   psutil.get_current_thread_id() might be desirable as per issue #418 though.

  * should psutil.TimeoutExpired exception have a 'msg' kwarg similar to
    NoSuchProcess and AccessDenied? Not that we need it, but currently we
    cannot raise a TimeoutExpired exception with a specific error string.

  * move exceptions into __init__.py so that visualized exception will look
    like psutil.{EXCEPTION} instead of psutil._error.{EXCEPTION}.
    __init__.py can push the exceptions into _ps*.py module after having
    imported them.


COMPATIBILITY BREAKAGE
======================

H = high risk in terms of breakage
M = medium risk in terms of breakage
S = little risk in terms of breakage
? = debatable

Removals:

 * (S) psutil.Process.nice  (deprecated in 0.5.0)
 * (S) get_process_list  (deprecated in 0.5.0)
 * (S) psutil.*mem* functions  (deprecated in 0.3.0 and 0.6.0)
 * (S) psutil.error.py  (deprecated in 0.7.0 but never documented)
 * (M) psutil.network_io_counters  (deprecated in 1.0.0)
 * (M) local_address and remote_address get_connection() namedtuple fields
       (deprecated in 1.0.0)

Renames:

 * (H) psutil.Process.ppid     -> get_ppid()
 * (H) psutil.Process.status   -> get_status()
 * (H) psutil.Process.uids     -> get_uids()
 * (H) psutil.Process.gids     -> get_gids()
 * (H) psutil.Process.username -> get_username()

 Others:

  * (M) make *cpu_percent's 'default' parameter default to 0.
