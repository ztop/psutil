
Introduction
============

psutil is a module providing an interface for retrieving information on running 
processes in a portable way by using Python.
It currently supports Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Windows.

psutil website is at http://code.google.com/p/psutil/

The following document describes how to compile and install psutil from sources 
on different platforms.


Using easy_install
==================

The easiest way to install psutil from sources is using easy_install. 
Get the latest easy_install version from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
and just run:

 > python easy_install psutil

This should get the most updated psutil version from the Python pypi repository, 
unpack it, compile it and install it automatically.


Installing on Windows using mingw32
===================================

After the mingw [1] environment is properly set up on your system you can 
compile Windows sources by entering:

 > setup.py build -c mingw32

To compile and install just append the "install" keyword at the end of the
command line above, like this:

 > setup.py build -c mingw32 install

It might be possible that distutils will complain about missing gcc executable.
That means you have to add mingw bin PATH variable first.
Entering this line in the command prompt should do the work:

 > SET PATH=C:\MinGW\bin;%PATH%
